I have chosen to work with data in education because the entire point of my getting my degree is to pursue a Ph.D. so that I conduct research and teach as my career and less industry software engineering as I do now.</p>\n<p>I wanted to tackle some more meaningful scenarios to implement my dictionary for. For example, I wanted to use fake data for a study on the benefits of project-based learning in computer science, but the data just became too complex for the scope of this learning journal, so I went with what is below.</p>\n<p>My original dictionary is a student roster. The keys represent courses at UofPeople while the values are lists that contain strings of the students in those courses. The shape this data currently has is very useful to maybe the teacher of one of the courses because they have a complete list of all the students taking their course.</p>\n<p>However, for an advisor of these students, it may be better to have a dictionary of students, where the keys are the students, and the values are lists of the courses that particular student is taking. This could help them better serve each student individually.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from pprint import pprint\n\n# original dictionary\nroster = {\n    \"CS1101\": [\"John Smith\", \"Alice Lee\", \"Bob Johnson\"],\n    \"MATH1202\": [\"Jane Doe\", \"Alice Lee\", \"David Kim\", \"John Smith\"],\n    \"UNIV1001\": [\"Samuel Lee\", \"Emily Chen\", \"John Smith\"]\n}\n\n# modified invert function\ndef invert_dict(d):\n    inverse = dict()\n    # printing the original dictionary in a \"pretty\" format\n    pprint(d, stream=None, indent=4)\n    # looping through the keys of the oringal dictionary\n    for course in d:\n        # looping through the values in the lists of each course\n        for student in d[course]:\n            val = student\n            # if val is not in the inverse dictionary, create a key of that value an assign the value to a list with the current course in it\n            if val not in inverse:\n                inverse[val] = [course]\n            # else, append the current course at the end of the list in the appropriate keys value\n            else:\n                inverse[val].append(course)\n    # print the inverted dictionary in a \"pretty\" format\n    pprint(inverse, stream=None, indent=4)\n    return inverse\n\n# call the function and pass roster as an argument\ninvert_dict(roster)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above code, I have modified the original function in few ways as far as naming conventions and other subtle ways, but the main change is adding the nested loop. This loop is there so that we can traverse the lists of each key in the original dictionary. While this does make our function more complex, it is how we can traverse that second layer of data as shown in Downey's (2015) discussion of traversing a list(chap. 10.3) in our textbook. The original function was only set up to traverse a dictionary with one layer of abstraction. We have to modify it to accommodate two.</p>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">{\n    'CS1101': ['John Smith', 'Alice Lee', 'Bob Johnson'],\n    'MATH1202': ['Jane Doe', 'Alice Lee', 'David Kim', 'John Smith'],\n    'UNIV1001': ['Samuel Lee', 'Emily Chen', 'John Smith']\n}\n{\n    'Alice Lee': ['CS1101', 'MATH1202'],\n    'Bob Johnson': ['CS1101'],\n    'David Kim': ['MATH1202'],\n    'Emily Chen': ['UNIV1001'],\n    'Jane Doe': ['MATH1202'],\n    'John Smith': ['CS1101', 'MATH1202', 'UNIV1001'],\n    'Samuel Lee': ['UNIV1001']\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Downey, A.
